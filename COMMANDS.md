## FindItem

Parameters:  

- Item: either a number or a string.
- ContainerID: a number, optional.

Useful for pretty much any item in game.
If Item is a number, FindItem will search for a dynamic object having the given ObjectID.
If Item is a string, FindItem will search for all the dynamic objects whose Name contains the given string.

If ContainerID is given, FindItem will only search within the container having the given ObjectId.

### Examples
  - FindItem("hatchet") *finds all hatchets and stores the result in FINDITEMID*
  - FindItem("hatchet",tonumber(BACKPACKID)) *finds all hatchet in your backpack and stores the result in FINDITEMID*

## FindPermanent

Parameters:  

- Permanent: either a number or a string.
- Distance: maximum search distance. If not specified, it defaults to 30.

Useful for trees, rocks, etc.
If Permanent is a number, FindPermanent will search for a permanent object having the given PermanentID.
If Permanent is a string, FindPermanent will search for all the permanent objects whose Name contains the given string.

### Examples
  - FindPermanent("tree") *finds all trees and stores the result in FINDITEMID*

## Key

Unused.

## Move

Parameters:  
- x: x coordinate.
- y: y coordinate.
- z: z coordinate.

or alternatively

- id: ObjectID.

Character will attempt to move at the given location x, y, and z, or if an ObjectID was provided, will attempt to move at the location of the given ObjectID.  
Please note that pathfinding will be used, but if there are obstacles such as doors the action will probably fail and character will stay at the original position.  
Likewise, if the location is too far from the current position than just a couple of screens, the action will probably fail and character will stay at the original position.  
A sleep() command may be desired after the call to Move() to allow the character time to walk to the location.

## Stop

Parameters:  
None.

If the character is moving, it will stop.

## ScanJournal

Parameters:  
- timestamp: timestamp in seconds.

The journal will be scanned, and it will return the first entry that immediately follows the given timestamp.  
If the timestamp provided is equal to 0, it will return the very first message of the journal.  

## Macro

Parameters:
- macro: a number.

It will execute the given macro.  
Macros dropped on the left bar are usually from 0-27.
